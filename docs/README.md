![Devo Energy Dome Adapter](../images/cover.jpg)

A 3D printable 45 RPM record adapter inspired by the iconic red "Energy Dome" hats worn by the new wave band Devo. This adapter allows you to play 45 RPM singles on a standard turntable while paying homage to one of music's most recognizable fashion statements.

## Overview

This project provides files to 3D print a functional 45 RPM record adapter shaped like Devo's famous Energy Dome hat. The adapter is designed to fit standard turntable spindles and properly support 45 RPM singles.

## About Devo's Energy Dome

The Energy Dome was first worn by Devo in 1980 during their Freedom of Choice tour. Designed by Gerald Casale, it has become an iconic symbol of the band and new wave culture. The band claimed it was designed to "collect energy that escapes from the top of the head" and "recycle it back into the body."
