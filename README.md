When a problem comes along, you must print it! This 3D printable 45 RPM record adapter is inspired by Devo's iconic red "Energy Dome" hats. Now your turntable can be as stylish as Mark Mothersbaugh himself!

## Whip It Into Shape (Quick Start)

1. Download the STL file from the `models` directory
2. Print it good! (PLA or PETG recommended)
3. Freedom of choice - place it on your turntable spindle to play those sweet 45 RPM singles

## Through Being Cool (Repository Contents)

- `src/` - OpenSCAD source file (for when you want to get satisfaction)
- `models/` - Ready-to-print 3D model files (STL, 3MF)
- `images/` - Beautiful mutants (photos and video of the adapter)
- `docs/` - For when you need to read the directions... RTFM!

For complete documentation that will crack that whip, see [docs/README.md](docs/README.md)
